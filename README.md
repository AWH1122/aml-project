### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AWH1122/<repository-name>
    cd ml-project
    ```

2. If on macOS, run the following command:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

3. If on Windows, run the following command:
    ```powershell
    .\setup.ps1
    ```

    If you encounter issues running the script, you may need to change the execution policy for the current session. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    ```
    Then run the script again.
